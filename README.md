Hello, I'm Brandy Brewer! ðŸŒŸ

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Disney (5+ yrs), mom to a toddler, and chaos engineering queen ðŸ‘‘. I led my SRE team to slash incidents by 53% YoY with Terraform, Grafana, and Python, earning exec high-fives. Certified in AWS (Cloud Practitioner, AI Practitioner) and Azure (Fundamentals), Iâ€™m chasing AWS Solutions Architect and Azure Administrator while building Python projects like AI-powered Raspberry Pi gadgets for my kiddo. Balancing career strides and mom life, Iâ€™m growing a garden ðŸŒ± and tech skills before we continue to grow our family!


ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Rocking:

Chaos testing AWS ECS/Lambda with Python, boto3, and Bedrock for bulletproof systems.

Automating clouds with Terraform, Jenkins, Grafana, and Prometheus.

Using AWS AI (Bedrock, SageMaker) to supercharge SRE and IoT projects.



ðŸŒˆ Fun Projects:

Chaos Testing Kit: Python scripts for failure injection.

Implementing Gremlin and Harness for a more broad ability for injecting chaos.
